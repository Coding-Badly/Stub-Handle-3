# bladestick (aka Stub Handle 3)

Print as presented.  The handle should be on its side.  The collar should be on its top face.

In KISSlicer...
- Style = _Mechanical - Low Density (stock)_ with no other changes gave good results.
- Support = _Normal_ with no other changes gave good results but left a great deal of scaffolding to clean up.

General...
- ABS is a good choice.
- The handle is designed to perfectly fit Bosch T-shank jig saw blades.  Reverse tooth blades (part number ends with "R") work well.
